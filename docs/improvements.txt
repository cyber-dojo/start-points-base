Rename default branch to main

Protect main branch.
See message at top of https://github.com/cyber-dojo/start-points-base

Should there be a --verbose flag that you can add to
$ cyber-dojo start-point create ...
which controls whether --quiet is added as a flag or not?
Better still, have an env-var that is automatically passed in?

# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

At the moment, when a
$ cyber-dojo start-point create ...
command fails, you can get some stdout, eg

  git clone file:///Users/jonathonjagger/repos/cyber-dojo/start-points-base/tmp/h1TP1y/languages_bad_json
  --languages 	 file:///Users/jonathonjagger/repos/cyber-dojo/start-points-base/tmp/h1TP1y/languages_bad_json

and then you get some stderr, eg

  ERROR: bad JSON in manifest.json file
  --languages ${tmp_url}
  manifest='languages-python-unittest/start_point/manifest.json'
  744: unexpected token at 'sdfsdf'

Would it be better if you only got stderr when there is an error,
and only got stdout when there is no error?
